The housing of the product is designed to be DIY built, using one sheet of poplar wood and one sheet of MDF (medium density fibre). This material is chosen for its flexibility and to provide one of the curved edges for the product. 
This edge serves as the reference point for the user to know which side is up.  The joints at the moment are glued together. Future possibilities could include screws, that enhances the repairability of the product. 

Specifications: 
Sheet 1: 900 x 300 (3mm MDF)
