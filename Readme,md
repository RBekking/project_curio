# An open source Human Computer Interface to help Blind users to code
 
We are working on the project for my thesis in Integrated Product Design, and I wanted to make this project open source, so as to augment its impact. 

# The Story
I am an Integrated Product Design  student of the Industrial Design Faculty at the Delft University of Technology. My thesis is on 'Development of a HCI device to enable
blind children to learn coding'. In the 21st century, learning to code is synonymous and as important as learning a new language. Lack of Computational Thinking (CT), 
which coding helps to develop, results in employability opportunities for blind people. Visually impaired people have a hard time finding job opportunities. Finding one 
requires their workplace and their travel to the workplace are accessible too. Moreover, the popular assistive tools like Refreshable Braille Displays  are used as
the 'only' available option in the market to help blind people to code. There are four major problems that leads this user group to shy away from coding- 

 1) The global braille literacy is very low, meaning most of them depend on screen readers as they cannot use braille based assistive aids. According to the European Blind
     Union, braille illiteracy causes 75% of their unemployability scenarios.

 2) Refreshable braille displays are expensive, for individuals in the middle and low income groups to afford. During my research in India, I found that only a  few (even) 
    blind schools knew about these braille displays and that too they have seen only in the magazines/ websites. It is simply too expensive to own one. 

 3) Screen readers (that is available for free) is designed to read naturallanguage and not source code. Though these softwares can be configured to read symbols or to 
     skip them, it is often difficult to say which configuration would best suited to understand the code in consideration, and 

 4) Use of these aids, greatly reduces the productivity (in professional environments) and ability to learn from peers and collaborate (in school environments)



 # Some background research

In the past two decades, several educational materials have been developed for children to learn digital skills like LEGO Mindstorms, BBC Micro:bit, online games and puzzles.
Most programming languages for children are block based, meaning they arrange virtual blocks on the screen to form a logical pattern. The debugging is also presented 
with visual cues . The output is also in the form of visual- animations and digital games. However these materials are not accessible to visually impaired children.  Programming
languages for children and teens are mostly block based, like SCRATCH and BLOCKLY. An Interview with the ICT teacher at a Visio, an umbrella organisation for blind schools 
in the Netherlands,  revealed that the common medium of insruction for high school blind students is Python language. Studies by McKay and Kolling, 2013 explains that
 block languages are suited to deletion and movement, while textual language are suited for some other tasks like insertion and replacement. Owing to the fact that the 
 project aims at gearing up students to suit the employment market better, a textual programming language in python was chosen as the starting point. 

As the ICT world is becoming increasingly accessible to users with disabilities including blindness, languages like Quorum have been developed in recent years. It is the worldâ€™s
first evidence based programming language developed upon the SodBeans environment. Although equipped with an array of accessible features like 3D spatial sound cues, 
compatibility to braille devices and a well supported team of academic developers, there comes a question if a dedicated language is welcomed by blind users. Interviews 
with blind programmers have revealed that they need a more accessible language than a  dedicated programming language, mainly due to access to the unmatched main 
stream content and support (eg, P   ython, Java etc)

# Design goal
 What if an interface can be designed for blind children to learn to code (which can be also used at a professional workplace setting) in order to enhance the
 user's productivity, ability to collaborate and reduce cognitive load (and hence work/study related stress)? 

 # Design Focus
 - Enabling blind users to skim through code (code blocks and hierarchy) and to understand the logic of the code. This is currently not possible and the users form mental
    mind maps to understand the code, while their sighted counterparts can easily skim through code and understand it
 - Designing a low cost, easy to build interface, so that users in the middle and lower economic sections can benefit from the ICT Job market
 - Developing an open source model, with emphasis on value generation through 'Share your wealth' business model.
